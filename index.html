          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>"To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often." - Winston Churchill</p>
            <p>The world is always changing. Technology has evolved more in periods as short as the last few years than
            many would have ever thought possible, and I fully intend to evolve with it. Whether through widely
            understood applications like the Microsoft Office Suite, or through more esoteric but general purpose skills
            like the Python, MySQL, and R programming languages, I am always looking for new skills and technologies to
            learn and to leverage towards achieving the goals of my organisation.</p>

          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>"Communication is the key to education, understanding, and peace." - James Bryce</p>
            <p>Effective communication is essential to the success of any enterprise. Throughout my education and career
            I have had the good fortune of being given ample opportunities to develop my communication skills across a
            wide swath of media. Literature reviews, analytical documents, in-person and digital presentation, and
            data preparation are only some of the myraid ways that I have developed my ability to clearly and effectively
            communicate information in a professional and personal setting.</p>
